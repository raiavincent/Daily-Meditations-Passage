## Meditations Passages Project
The Meditation Passages Project is a program which disseminates a passage from Marcus Aurelius's renowned _The Meditatons_, which is a collection of writings from his daily journal. It is foundational to the Stoic philosphy, and has inspired myself, my friends, and countless others. This project allows you to read one of his thoughts a day and meditate on it.

### Modules Used
The main module that is used to run is [EZGmail](https://pypi.org/project/EZGmail/), developed by Al Sweigart, to send the passage from a gmail account set up for this specific purpose.

Next and also as import is the [schedule](https://pypi.org/project/schedule/), which easily allows the code to run on set days and time, so the passage is there in the morning.

### How To Use
Simply download the files that I have placed in the [repository](https://github.com/raiavincent/Meditations-Project), install schedule and EZGmail (easy to do with the instructions on the package site), place your email address in a separate text file called stoic emails.txt and you are good to go! If you would like, I can also add you to my distribution list so I can worry about the nitty gritty.

### Stoicism
If you are new to stoicism and would like to know more, I would reccomend reading _The Meditations_ or visiting [The Daily Stoic](https://dailystoic.com/) and reading books from Ryan Holiday.
